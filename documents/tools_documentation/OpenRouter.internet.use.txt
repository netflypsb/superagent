You can incorporate relevant web search results for _any_ model on OpenRouter by activating and customizing the `web` plugin, or by appending `:online` to the model slug:

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4o:online"
}
```

This is a shortcut for using the `web` plugin, and is exactly equivalent to:

```json
{
  "model": "openrouter/auto",
  "plugins": [{ "id": "web" }]
}
```

The web search plugin is powered by [Exa](https://exa.ai) and uses their ["auto"](https://docs.exa.ai/reference/how-exa-search-works#combining-neural-and-keyword-the-best-of-both-worlds-through-exa-auto-search) method (a combination of keyword search and embeddings-based web search) to find the most relevant results and augment/ground your prompt.

## Parsing web search results

Web search results for all models (including native-only models like Perplexity and OpenAI Online) are available in the API and standardized by OpenRouterto follow the same annotation schema in the [OpenAI Chat Completion Message type](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/object):

```json
{
  "message": {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Here's the latest news I found: ...",
    "annotations": [
      {
        "type": "url_citation",
        "url_citation": {
          "url": "https://www.example.com/web-search-result",
          "title": "Title of the web search result",
          "content": "Content of the web search result", // Added by OpenRouter if available
          "start_index": 100, // The index of the first character of the URL citation in the message.
          "end_index": 200 // The index of the last character of the URL citation in the message.
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Customizing the Web Plugin

The maximum results allowed by the web plugin and the prompt used to attach them to your message stream can be customized:

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4o:online",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "id": "web",
      "max_results": 1, // Defaults to 5
      "search_prompt": "Some relevant web results:" // See default below
    }
  ]
}
```

By default, the web plugin uses the following search prompt, using the current date:

```
A web search was conducted on `date`. Incorporate the following web search results into your response.

IMPORTANT: Cite them using markdown links named using the domain of the source.
Example: [nytimes.com](https://nytimes.com/some-page).
```

## Pricing

The web plugin uses your OpenRouter credits and charges _\$4 per 1000 results_. By default, `max_results` set to 5, this comes out to a maximum of \$0.02 per request, in addition to the LLM usage for the search result prompt tokens.

## Non-plugin Web Search

Some models have built-in web search. These models charge a fee based on the search context size, which determines how much search data is retrieved and processed for a query.

### Search Context Size Thresholds

Search context can be 'low', 'medium', or 'high' and determines how much search context is retrieved for a query:

- **Low**: Minimal search context, suitable for basic queries
- **Medium**: Moderate search context, good for general queries
- **High**: Extensive search context, ideal for detailed research

### Specifying Search Context Size

You can specify the search context size in your API request using the `web_search_options` parameter:

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4.1",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
    }
  ],
  "web_search_options": {
    "search_context_size": "high"
  }
}
```
