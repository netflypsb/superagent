description: tavily search tool and how to use it in vercel ai sdk as a tool for agents. 

Tavily search API integration offering advanced web search capabilities. Includes comprehensive search, context-aware search, Q&A functionality, and content extraction from URLs with customizable search parameters.

Available Tools
Each tool below represents a capability that can be added to your Language Model. When integrated, these tools allow your LLM to perform specific actions and access external services through the AI SDK:
1. search: Search for information on Tavily
2. searchContext: Search for information on Tavily with context
3. searchQNA: Search for information on Tavily with Q&A
4. extractContent: Extract content from a URL

Install:
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://ai-sdk-agents.vercel.app/r/tavily.json

Usage:
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'
import { streamText, convertToCoreMessages } from 'ai'
import { tavilyTools } from '@/lib/tools/tavily'
// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json()

  const apiKey = process.env.TAVILY_API_KEY

  if (!apiKey) {
    return new Response('No API key provided', { status: 400 })
  }

  const result = await streamText({
    model: openai('gpt-4o'),
    messages: convertToCoreMessages(messages),
